simple java calulator
*I'm a windows user
In this repo you will find an .exe file, a jar file and a .java file. The .exe is the executable that can run independently without java, the .jar is the an executable for java (to run this jar cd to the directory where you put it then java -jar calculator.jar) and .java is the source file for you to inspect and edit. I use Launch4j, which creates .exe from .jar files so I included them all here for your comfort. 
*The jar works the same as the exe.
